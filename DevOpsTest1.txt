DevOps Engineer Technical Test 

Exercise 
• In a programming language of your choice, create a simple web server that responds to 
GET /hello and responds with “OK” and a 200-status code. 
• Deploy this web server in an AWS account in a style of your choice. 
• Use Infrastructure as Code to automate the creation of the resources. 
• Secure the application in a way you see fit. 
• Provide a cost estimate of the design. 

Deliverables 
• Provide the URL and codebase back to Cochlear 
• Provide the cost of the solution per month, for 1M requests, with a break down per AWS resource 
• Provide a diagram of your design 

Notes 
• AWS has free tiers for most resources. You can assume we will not put any load on your 
URL provided as to not incur your personal costs. However, if you prefer, you can 
immediately tear down your stack, and instead of a URL, provide a screenshot of a 
working request, including all request and response headers, status and body. 
• You are welcome to spend if you like on this, or timebox and discuss future steps with us 

Hints 
To help with the time taken to do this task, here are some hints. Feel free to use or ignore them 

• You should use this opportunity to demonstrate that you have the technical knowledge 
to be successful in this role. A successful candidate will be a person who is not just 
completing tickets, but instead is someone who can provide input to design decisions, 
follow best practices, and perform peer reviews. 
• Use Terraform or CloudFormation to do your infrastructure as code, both are modern 
and well-documented 
• A “vanity” url (eg https://my-devops-test.com/hello) is not required (purchasing a new 
domain name is not required). AWS generated urls are fine. 
• Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk and Kubernetes are quick to set up, but may not show off as much skill as other techniques 
• Please make any relevant assumptions and state them in your codebase in a logical place 
• If you wish to use NodeJS for your server, you can set up a zero dependencies server and 
run wit with node <filename>.js: 

const { createServer } = require('http'); 
const port = process.env.PORT ?? 8080; 
createServer(function (req, res) { 
res.writeHead(200); 
res.write('OK'); 
res.end(); 
}).listen(port); 
console.log(`Server listening at localhost:${port}`); 

• If you wish to use lambda, some code for that would be: 

export const handler = async (event) => { 
let response = { 
statusCode: 200, 
body: "OK", 
}; 
return response; 
}
